Next Steps and Future Enhancements

This document outlines potential future developments, improvements, and considerations for the Telegram Job project.

## Core Functionality Enhancements

### I like to integrate Youtube. 

1. First step is the login to youtube via playwright. this should then create a pickle file, where the youtube login is stored.
2. when I have a URL which contains a "youtube.com" or "you.te" or "yt.be" it is a youtube video. Go into the url with the pickle file from the step before and like the video and subscribe the channel. 
3. Make a screenshot and save it. this functions already exist in the playwrightstuff.py
